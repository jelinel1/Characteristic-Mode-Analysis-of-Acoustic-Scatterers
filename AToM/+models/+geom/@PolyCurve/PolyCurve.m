%% PolyCurve curve composed of several curves
%
% This class defines a curve composed of several types of lines (Line,
% EllipseArc, EquationCurve and ParllelogramFrame). It finds junctions
% between individual curves. The class finds out, if curves build a closed
% loop or not. If so, the counterclockwise order is found.
