%% getAngleBetweenVectors compute angle between two vectors
% This function computes angle between vector 1 defined in 3D Euclidean
% space by _vect1_ and 3D vector 2 _vect2_ .
%
%  INPUTS
%   vect1: 3D vector, double [1 x 3]
%   vect2: 3D vector, double [1 x 3]
%
%  OUTPUTS
%   angle: angle between vector 1 and vector 2, double [1 x 1] in [rad]
%
%  SYNTAX
%
%  angle = models.utilities.geomPublic.getAngleBetweenVectors(vect1, vect2)
%
% Function getAngleBetweenVectors computes angle between two vectors in 3D
% defined by _vect1_ and _vect2_.
