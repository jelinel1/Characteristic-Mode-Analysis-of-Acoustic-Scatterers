% DIFFXY - accurate numerical derivative/differentiation of Y w.r.t X.
%
%   DY = DIFFXY(X,Y) returns the derivative of Y with respect to X using a
%        pseudo second-order accurate method. DY has the same size as Y.
%   DY = DIFFXY(X,Y,DIM) returns the derivative along the DIM-th dimension
%        of Y. The default is differentiation along the first
%        non-singleton dimension of Y.
%   DY = DIFFXY(X,Y,DIM,N) returns the N-th derivative of Y w.r.t. X.
%        The default is 1.
%
%   Y may be an array of any dimension.
%   X can be any of the following:
%       - array X with size(X) equal to size(Y)
%       - vector X with length(X) equal to size(Y,DIM)
%       - scalar X denotes the spacing increment
%   DIM and N are both integers, with 1<=DIM<=ndims(Y)
%
%   DIFFXY has been developed especially to handle unequally spaced data,
%   and features accurate treatment for end-points.
%
%   Example:
%   % Data with equal spacing
%     x = linspace(-1,2,20);
%     y = exp(x);
%
%     dy = diffxy(x,y);
%     dy2 = diffxy(x,dy);  % Or, could use >> dy2 = diffxy(x,y,[],2);
%     figure('Color','white')
%     plot(x,(y-dy)./y,'b*',x,(y-dy2)./y,'b^')
%
%     Dy = gradient(y)./gradient(x);
%     Dy2 = gradient(Dy)./gradient(x);
%     hold on
%     plot(x,(y-Dy)./y,'r*',x,(y-Dy2)./y,'r^')

%
%   Example:
%   % Data with unequal spacing.
%     x = 3*sort(rand(20,1))-1;
%     % Run the example above from y = exp(x)
