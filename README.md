# Characteristic-Mode-Analysis-of-Acoustic-Scatterers
This repository contains MATLAB code evaluating characteristic modes of acoustic scatterers. The boundary element method with equivalent surface impedance is used. The object is described by a triangular mesh.
The theory is described in DOI: XXXXX. Run script "charModesOfHelmholtzResonator.m" to replicate the results of Section 7.3. Refer to the commentaries in the code for more details.
